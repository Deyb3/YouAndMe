    <div class="letter">
      Another month with u again and honestly every month with u feels like a blessing. I know I’m not always easy to understand or be with but even with that u’re still here. Thank u so much, baby for loving me and choosing to understand me.

      In our three months together, we’ve been through so many challenges, countless disagreements and misunderstandings, but even then we choose to stay and keep loving each other. You are the most beautiful gift I’ve ever received and I thank God every day that u came into my life.

      I’m so lucky ’cuz u became my baby. Through all the exhaustion and hardships, you became my rest and my home. You’re not just part of my world for me you’re my universe.
